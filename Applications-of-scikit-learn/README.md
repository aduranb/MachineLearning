# Applications of scikit-learn library for Machine Learning

## Intro
Machine Learning is the semi-automated extraction of knowledge out of data.

1. Question assumed to be answered with available data.
2. Apply some algorithm into the data so that the computer can return the answer.
3. Make use of many smart decisions in order to be successful.

There are two main categories of ML:

-__Supervised Learning__:
Also known as predicting modelling, means making predictions out of data. There is an specific outcome to predic.

-__Unsupervised Learning__:
Extracting structure from data, or know how to best represent data. There is no right or wrong answer.

### How does it work
At a very high level, there are two main steps for supervised ML:

    1. Train the algorithm using existing labeled data (solved examples, so to say).
    
    2. Make predictions on new data for which you don't know the new outcome, without a human examining.

The algorithm is learning from known data to make predictions.

- How do I choose __which attributes__ of my data to include in the model?
- How do I choose __which model__ to use?
- How do I __optimize__ this model for best performance?
- How do I ensure that I'm building a model that will __generalise__ to unseen data?
- Can I __estimate__ how well my model is likely to perform on unseen data?
